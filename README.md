# Description

MemsTh App has 3 paths (Regular, Hot, NoneExist for bad URL).

Data are stayed in local extend and they are downloaded from dataApp.js.

App use Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContex) for manage state. My createContext is defined in AppContext.js

In the project, you don't find Redux or MobX solutions.
